# Hackathon lunar lander

Lunar lander-type game made during an 8-hour hackathon at work. "Natural gas remaining", "Invoices delivered", and "Gainesville, we have a problem" are inside jokes from our company.

## How to play

Use the left, right, and up cursor keys to control the lunar lander.  Make sure to not land on the platform with too much velocity or you will crash the lander.
